# Use `std::copy` or `std::copy_n` instead of `std::memcpy`

## Status

[ ] proposed, [X] accepted, [ ] rejected, [ ] deprecated, [ ] superseded

## Context

See <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/memcpy>

> If the objects overlap, the behavior is undefined.
> ...
> std::memcpy is meant to be the fastest library routine for memory-to-memory copy. It is usually more efficient than std::strcpy, which must scan the data it copies or std::memmove, which must take precautions to handle overlapping inputs.

See <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4707012/is-it-better-to-use-stdmemcpy-or-stdcopy-in-terms-to-performance>

> All compilers I know will replace a simple `std::copy` with a `memcpy` when it is appropriate, or even better, vectorize the copy so that it would be even faster than a `memcpy`.

(Not sure what **vectorize** means in this context and how it can improve the performance.)

Note that `std::copy` and `std::copy_n` are type safe template functions. `std::memcpy` accepts `void*` arguments:

```c++
void* memcpy( void* dest, const void* src, std::size_t count );
```

## Decision

Use `std::copy` and `std::copy_n`.

## Consequences

I don't need the object overlap support. I should implement a check when copy a packet buffer and check that source and destination buffers do not overlap.
